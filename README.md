# Path Validator CLI Tool

A command-line tool for validating and fixing path naming conventions across your project files so you can deploy without any issues. 

## Features

- Validates file and directory names against common naming conventions.
- Support for HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript projects.
- Detects issues like:
  - Spaces in filenames
  - Special characters
  - Inconsistent casing
  - Platform-specific path incompatibilities
- üõ†Ô∏è Automatically fixes detected issues (when not using --check-only)
- üìã Generates detailed reports of found issues
- ‚ö° Fast and lightweight



## Installation

```bash
npm install -g path-validator-cli
```

## Usage

There are two main ways to use the path validator:

### 1. Check and Fix Mode (Default)
```bash
path-validator
```
This will:
- Scan your current directory
- Report any path issues found
- Automatically fix the issues by renaming files/directories

### 2. Check-Only Mode
```bash
path-validator --check-only
```
This will:
- Scan your current directory
- Report any path issues found
- Not make any changes to your files

## Examples

```bash
# Check and fix paths in the current directory
path-validator

# Only check paths without making changes
path-validator --check-only

```

## Dependencies

- **chalk**: Colors and styles text output in the terminal 
- **commander**: Creates and manages command-line interfaces (CLI) and parses arguments 
- **fast-glob**: Quickly finds files and directories using pattern matching 
- **figlet**: Converts text into ASCII art banners 
- **inquirer**: Creates interactive command-line prompts and forms
- **ora**: Displays elegant loading spinners in the terminal



## Output

The tool provides detailed feedback about invalid paths found in your codebase:

Each issue shows:
- The invalid path that was found
- The file where this path is referenced where you can ctr-click(pc) or command-click(mac) to go to the referenced file
- The exact line number where the reference occurs
- A helpful suggestion for fixing the issue
- ..and a passive aggressive reality check based on how many issues there are.
